# odin-form
Personal sign up form project from The Odin Project. Taught me to use custom properties, google font api, better selectors on top of using class selectors, system font as back up font, css reset, creating event listeners using form Node objects and storing the data using FormData objects. I used media queries and display flex for the form to keep things responsive with different screen sizes.
